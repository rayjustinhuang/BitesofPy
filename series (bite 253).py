    of letters.
    Be careful, although this sounds very similar to the .mask() method,
        that's not what we're looking for here.
    For example. Give the series x:
        0    0

        2    2
        3    3

    You can create a mask for even numbers like this:
    >>> mask = x % 2 == 0
    >>> mask
        0     True
        1    False
        2     True

    >>> x[mask]
        0    0
        2    2
        4    4
        dtype: int64

    Of course for simpler masks you can just do this:
    >>> x[x %2 == 0]
        0    0
